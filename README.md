BloodView ðŸ©¸
BloodView is a simple website to manage a blood bankâ€™s inventory. It helps small blood banks keep track of blood donations and usage. You can add new blood donations, remove blood when itâ€™s used, check how much blood is in stock, and make sure only authorized people access the system with secure logins. The site is easy to use and works well for small teams.
